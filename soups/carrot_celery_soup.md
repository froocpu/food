# Cleansing carrot and celery soup

## Pre-requisites

A food processor to blend the soft stuff into soup.

## Ingredients

Serves 1-2:

- 1 white onion
- 2 large carrots
- 2 large sticks of celery

## Method

1. Finely chop the onion and simmer in a pan with some oil/butter until they go soft.
2. Once the onions are soft, slice the celery and add to the pan to soften them too. Maybe do this for 3-4 mins or so.

4. Season with salt and top up with water until everything is soft and ready to blend.
