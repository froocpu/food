# Chicken and Chorizo Tray Bake

Serves 3/4

## Ingredients

- 4 chicken thighs
- 225g chorizo
- 1/2 red onion
- 1/2 bag baby potatoes
- Salt and pepper
- Garlic oil
- Oregano

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 180C.
2. Line the tray with oil and rub the oil onto the skin of the chicken thighs.
3. Finely chop the onion and thinly slice the chorizo. Place into the tray with the chicken.
4. Chop the baby potatoes in half and place inside the tray. The oil from the chorizo will cover the potatoes in the oven and turn into a nice golden layer.
