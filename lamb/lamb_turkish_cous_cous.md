# Lamb dinner

Variation of a Gousto recipe. Serves 3-4

## Ingredients

- 250-300g lamb mince or meatballs
- 20g tomato paste
- 150g cous cous
- 1x chicken stock cube and 1x beef stock cube
- 3 medium-large tomatoes
- 1 red onion
- 1 tsp oregano
- 1 tsp cumin
- Dill (fresh or not, who cares)
- 1 large aubergine
- Natural yogurt, about 5/6 tablespoons


## Method

1. Make the cous cous first. Just add the stock cube to 200ml of hot water, then add to the cous cous. It'll absorb it all. Cover it, fluff it up later when it's all absorbed and it's all done.
2. Slice the aubergine in half. Make cuts in the aubergine so that it cooks through. Add to a baking tray, cover the flesh in oil and salt and then put in the oven for 15 minutes.
3. While it cooks, cut the red onion and tomatoes into wedges and add to a separate baking tray. Add oil and salt. Leave on the side.
4. Quickly make tomato stock - add the beef stock cube to 200ml water and the tomato puree and mix together.
5. Meanwhile, start cooking the meat:
    - If it's mince, cook for a few minutes until brown. If meatballs, cook until you've browned the tops and bottoms of the meatballs. They should cook through a little bit.
    - Add cumin and oregano and cook for a minute or so.
    - Add the tomato stock you made earlier. Add salt and peppet. Turn the heat down to low-medium and cover until the sauce goes thick and all the meat is cooked through.
6. When the aubergine has been cooking for 15 mins or so, take out and press down on the flesh with a fork. Put back in for 15-20 mins.
7. At the same time, put in the tomatoes and red onion wedges and cook for 15-20 mins until soft or cooked through.
8. When the aubergine is cooked, take it out and scrape the flesh off of the skins onto a chopping board. Chop up a bit more and add to the yogurt with some garlic paste and give it all a good mix.
