# Homemade chicken kievs

## Ingredients

- Small plates of:
    - Flour
    - Egg (1/2, beaten)
    - Breadcrumbs (to make your coating)
- 3 large chicken breasts (should be able to make a slit/pocket in the side.)
- 100-150g butter (in a block preferrably, so place in the fridge for a bit.)
- Garlic paste
- Tenderstem broccoli
- Oil

## Method

> It's a bit messy, clean as you go.

> We're going to need an oven and a hot pan to do this, just FYI.

1. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees.
2. Place the broccoli in a tray with some oil drizzled on top and some salt sprinkled. Place in the oven for about 20-25 mins.
3. Cover your butter blocks (or mix if not in a block) with the garlic paste. Leave this on the side for a bit.
4. Make a deep slit in the sides of the chicken breasts. It should create a sort of pocket that the garlic butter can happily sit in without leaking out too much.
5. Heat a large pan with some oil until it's on a medium-high heat.

> This takes practice!

6. Coat the chicken in the following order:
    - Flour - dries it out
    - Egg - makes the coat
    - Breadcrumbs

> If you want an extra thick coat, do step 6 twice.

7. Fry the breasts in the pan for a few minutes on each side until the breadcrumbs go golden brown.
8. Find the slit you made earlier. Try to stand up the chicken breasts in a larger baking tray if you can, so that you can place the garlic butter disks inside the chicken breasts and most of it won't come out. Then place the second tray in the oven for about 25-30 minutes until cooked through.
9. Serve the broccoli with the chicken kievs.
