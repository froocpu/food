# Chicken and Chorizo Paella

Serves 4-6

## Ingredients

- 4-6 chicken thighs, bones removed (skin optional but not that great if you leave them on.)
    - Left over chicken is also really good if you have any to add.
- 2-3 tablespoons of paprika (smoked is even better)
- 30g tomato puree
- 1 large/2 medium brown onions
- 20g parsley leaves separated.
- 120g chorizo
- 1 carrot
- 350g paella rice or risotto rice.
- 800ml of chicken stock (1 or 2 cubes)

## Method

> Read ahead to step 3 and plan ahead.

1. Chop up the chorizo into small chunks. 
2. Cook the chunks in oil for about 5-10 minutes on a low heat until the meat cooks and the chorizo oil seeps out and flavours the oil. If you don't like chunks of chorizo in your paella, take them out and dry them off.
3. While it's cooking, chop up the onion finely and the carrot into small chunks as well.
4. When the chorizo is ready, add the onion and cook for a minute or two until soft.
5. When the onion is done, stick the thighs in and cook for a while **on a medium heat.** Turn them over occasionally (every few minutes) until they're a bit cooked.

> Try to keep the chicken separate from the onion!

6. Add the paprika and puree to the onion and toss until dry. Add the rice and toss a bit. 
7. Add the stock and make sure everything is covered (top up with water if not.) Add the lid and turn the heat down.

> The rice will absorb all of the water. When the water is nearly all gone, you should stir it occasionally and stop the rice from burning.

8. When everything is cooked through and the rice is ready, add the chopped parsley leaves and stir through.
